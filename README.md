# Seinfeld Script Generation

This is one of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree program projects.  

In this project, we'll generate our own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs by using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network we'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
